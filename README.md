- Installed using node version 16, but should work with later versions

This is a standard Next JS Project. All documentation on their website should help boot the application.

- No .env to add

To run:

```
yarn
yarn dev

```

## Follow-up

Working with Lush would be a fantastic opportunity. While it has taken some time to deliver this code test, more than I'd have liked, I've had a very limited time.

Most of the time spent has been on Sunday 23rd and Tuesday 25th July

Additional considerations, what would I add if I had more time, etc

- General tidy-ups, move types to different files/folders, better focus on naming
- Add better UI for sorting and managing content
- Add Lush product categories to click on across a horizontally scrollable area
- More detail, description, and usages of seoTitle, and seoDescription in the metadata for the page
- Mobile responsive for product page
- Read into next/image further, potentially use `<Image>` instead or srcset for different screens
